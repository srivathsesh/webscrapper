People that ride the clock and steal hours are not punished, but rather rewarded by getting big paychecks. I ignored all the favoritism and kept minding my own business. I was able to clear mid 60's and be home every night. That being said I worked 70 hour weeks for 2 years straight. This is important to know also....If you get hurt on the job they are self insured work comp. This is not a benefit to the injured party.The potential for this to be a great place to work is there. No seniority at my location code made tensions between drivers when it came to playing favorites for the easy jobs when they came up. Great pay and very bad benefits, United Healthcare with huge deductibles. Really good 401K 4 percent match. My location code had drivers drive and that's it, no touch freight, mostly preloaded trailers and live unloads and some drop and hooks. Electronic logs and in two direction dash cams. You are always being watched so no smoking and no cell phone use."

1072591207,Driver (Former Employee) –,CT,Waterbury,2018-09-26,1,"Nature of job was easy, but management is TERRIBLE",Most coworkers are good people.,"Management, especially terrible senior management in Hartford.",Ryder,"Worked as Transfer Driver out of Waterbury shop. It was easy (and low pay reflected that), but senior management gave little support to those who actually got things done. Meanwhile, they kept or promoted incompetents. Very political. One supervisor had no clue what he was doing, but then got promoted because of nepotism. Another supervisor knew his stuff, busted his butt for company, and was a talented young mechanic to boot, but the idiots in Hartford let him slip away because of their political BS. Company constantly harps, ""Zero tolerance."" But has one driver who has had incident after incident, speeding in customer's lot, accidents and didn't inform company, wastes tons of time stopping at convenience stores, etc, but management makes excuse after excuse to keep him. (And because he's supposedly on his last 'strike,' the snake tries to get his fellow co-drivers into trouble in multiple ways.) Meanwhile, if you are a good driver who does things in a safe, timely manner, but you get so much as a scratch on your arm that might need treatment, you are threatened with termination by the strong-arming regional manager. Totally backwards. Subsequently, turnover is rampant, at least in the Waterbury shop. This ends up putting much more work and strain on those still there, supervisors, techs, drivers, etc.. Over time this year, the place has become a mess. Breakrooms and bathrooms are a disgrace because cleaning crew no longer comes. They can't even afford to pay landscapers to cut the little strip of grass in front of shop. Add it all up and it's not a good situation."
1072248941,Driver (Current Employee) –,NA,Douglassville Pa,2018-09-09,2,Horrible place to work for a driver..you can do better,Benefits,"Too many miles, too many hours, cameras in trucks, not enough money!",Ryder,"Dont bother working here. My first week there 2 drivers quit that should of been a red flag right there Everything they say is a lie and they're full of broken promises. When I saw the ad for a driving position they said it was $21.00 per hour I end up getting the job and the day before I go out on my run I'm told they pay 0.43 cents per mile. Nowhere on the ad did they say they pay cents per mile...you drive 1,800-2,000 miles in 4 days and put in 10-12 hour days you're suppose to have off on Wednesday but they are so short on drivers they make you come in on your days off and run a local run and they still pay you cents per mile...you have to pay for your own hotel and they reimburse in your paycheck..so for example my paycheck every week is $1,075 and that's with them reimbursing me the $200-$300 I'm putting out every week for hotels..so if you take away the $200-$300 they reimburse you after all the work you put in your check is really anywhere from $700-$875 a week after all the hours and miles you do it isnt worth it..dont work here also they put cameras in the trucks to watch you"

Your work hours and off days can be changed at a days notice. It took 2 months for them to get my pay right and set up my direct deposit.
1069614007,Driver (Current Employee) –,IN,Jeffersonville,2018-04-30,1,Not a good place to work,None,Pay not equal to hours. Poor management,Ryder,If you like working long hours for little pay this is a great place. They have a 1000 dollar a week guarantee. Which is great until you realize how many hours you work an it averages 11 dollars an hour.

1069444371,Driver (Current Employee) –,NA,Georgia,2018-04-22,3,Easy Job,"Easy job, decent pay",Insurance/Benefits,Ryder,"My position is a very easy job. However, I dont know where these people claiming Ryder has great benefits are getting their insurance from. Ryder insurance is TERRIBLE. It's very expensive and all it is, is insurance from the Health Insurance Marketplace. You can only enroll in a certain period. It's, without a doubt, the worst insurance I have ever seen with a company."
1069443336,AZ Driver (Current Employee) –,NA,Toyota Canada Accounts,2018-04-22,5,Steamlined operations,"Easy work, industry average pay, steady regular hours",A little aloof regarding driver appreciation/recognition,Ryder,"If you are a newbie trucker, probably not the place for you as they expect you to be a professional who knows their stuff coming in. I see a lot of complaints on here that are obviously from newbie drivers who are not really familiar with the industry yet. But if it's not your first rodeo, Ryder is a great company to work for in my experience because for the most part, you get the same truck everyday, you pretty much know what your hours are going to be each week, management completely leaves you alone if you are doing your job correctly and on the TMMC accounts at least, the work is extremely easy work. No touch, big customer yards, fairly relaxed pickup/delivery schedule and the equipment, though not great, is not too bad. I think the oldest trucks we have on our account are 2013's. If I do have one complaint, it is the lack of social and driver appreciation programs. For a company as big as Ryder, they can do better than a $25 gift card from Walmart as a Christmas bonus. Quarterly safety meeting, though paid, are pretty useless as far as teaching an experienced driver anything new and burn 4 or 5 of your Saturdays per year. Dealing with Ryder's repair shops as a Ryder Integrated Logistics driver can be frustrating as they tend to prioritize rental customers rather than their own employees."
1069437157,Driver (Former Employee) –,FL,Lakeland,2018-04-21,5,Ryder best driving job,night shift work,Paid you for everything,Ryder,"It was the best driving job I had.

They say they have an open door policy until there is an issue. Just like you are the ""captain of the ship"" but try calling it and see what happens. Your just a paid puppet. You will be ok there as long as you shut up and do as your told and don't think for yourself! Some of these accounts are supposed to be local work, however, some people have to drive over an hour to get there and they don't take that into consideration when your supposed to have 10 hours rest!"

Miscommunication, lack of interest in employees from new managers, complaints would go unheard, etc. This job is good if you want to earn good money but you're gonna have to be an autonomous because management will be overloaded and stressed out. Otherwise, not as bad as other companies."

1067720057,Driver (Former Employee) –,TN,Nashville,2018-02-03,1,Very poorly managed,None,Management,Ryder,This is a policy and management driven company. All day we care about drivers but those are only words. Ryder cares about their managers and moving frieght. They talk all day about safety but that only matters when its convenient. If it puts manager in a bind then safety goes out the window. The pay is low . You will never advance and may get a raise every 2 or 3 years. Maybe. Basically you were warned.

You had over 22 stops to make in one night. I worked there for 6 months. The pay at the time was good, but the work was hard. Fast paced and keep you on your toes. Once all your deliveries were made you took the empty trailer to Bunny Bread drop it off and bobtailed back to Ryder to drop of the truck. then drive your car home and repeat it all over the next day. If I remember correctly they gave Tuesdays and Saturdays off."

Work is easy. Management has plenty of ideas on how to make it better but not much in the way of execution of those plans. It might get better but not for a while. All of us were told it was going to be a M-F weekends off schedule and that’s why they got so many applications and the first orientation class was huge.

There is small talk about the proposed moves of rental vehicles and I settle in and wait and listen for the instructions.I have learned patience and relaxation from this position as in most scenarios there is little to no rushing to meet a deadline.Management has been just as professional and polite with the drivers as with the customers who are drivers too.Co-workers can be unpredictable and the format is to have two ride together most of the time. It might help if both were interviewed together for compatibility purposes.The most difficult of duties in the job as I have experienced it has been in dealing with driver partners with extreme behavioral differences from myself. On the other hand, when a pairing is compatible the experience is pleasant and productive."

Lots of petty rules that were almost more important than getting the load to the customer on time.The drivers were the fuse in the whole place . If anything went wrong it was the drivers fault reguardless.Slip seating and had co drivers looking for any reason to complain about other drivers to make themselves look good.Things such as got dirt on floor of truck cab or ate something in cab that left a few crumbs even though you didnt have time to stop and eat on some of the schedules. I learned that no matter how you try in todays and their work enviroment you just a number and easily replaceable . High turnover. People came and went so much I didnt even try to learn their names anymore. They let some great skilled drivers go then wondered why no one wanted to stay or do anything extra.I was one of the few drivers that actually liked the place and now looking back i wouldnt go back and put up with all i went through just to be cast aside and neither are the other drivers from what I've seen in their ads for drivers.They had computer systems in the truck that always were acting up and would work for one driver more... and not the next then they would blame it on the driver.They would have people riding around in cars trying to catch you doing something wrong.

The managers are told to lie to the drivers and they do ! I work for them now and it is the biggest mistake I have ever made in my career !

When you contact your manager they tell you to go back to HR !! You cant access the employee manuel because it is constantly being revised.. so they can change the rules in midstream and not pay the drivers the time that they are owed. They are being sued currently for this very thing and have been sued in the past by drivers and lost in court.. at least the judges in these cases could see how corrupt Ryder is ! They dont care if you have been here 10 years .. 20 years.. no loyalty at all.. they will keep your vacation payr and not feel bad about it. The money that they dont pay you for your vacation goes into the managers pocket as a bonus.. be warned.. check this information out regarding the vacation pay for Ryder,, they also are putting cameras in our trucks in the next couple of weeks so they can watch the drivers constantly.. that way they wont have to pay safety bonuses out either.. more money in the managers pocket. I am writing this in hopes that another driver wont make this same mistake that I did. I have been here to long to get out.. but you can stop yourself from being put in the same position.. run away from this company and spread the word to more... other drivers that you know so that wont apply here either.

The shift supervisors treated their drivers like children and didn't realize that if it weren't for their drivers THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THEIR JOB! they knew nothing about frac sand much less how to order it. If this company would just hire managers with real time oilfield driving experience they would fair alot better.

You could make a round trip in half of the time they gave you and they would still question why it took you that long. I would not advise any driver to apply at the Lithia Springs location. I did hear other drivers at the other locations talk about how much happier they were at their locations. They want you to work 50+ hours a week, but then pay you part time wages with no benefits.

No real advancment.Penske management locally is awesome though and they make you want to do a good job.Contact management and staff are jerks who treat you like a moron.

Upon arrival I would inspect my truck and sign in to my electronic logs. I then helped the loaders finish loading the truck and then checked and secured my load. The length of the day varied depending on the miles driven and the type of deliveries made. I would then return to the warehouse and finalize unloading and paperwork. I was able to help my supervisor with routing which helped me keep those skills in use. The company we were contracted to work for was an interesting and sometimes frustrating experience including poor management and employees with bad attitudes as well as low safety standards. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the contracted company and not knowing when you would be finished on any given day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being outside in nice weather and interacting with the delivery customers.

The benefits are pretty good, the healthcare is affordable if ur single. The 4 day work week is catchy, but there's only 2 shifts (12AM-2AM & 4PM-6PM) All the equipment (electric jacks, manuel jacks, hand trucks, tractors, trailers etc..) is shared between the AM PM drivers so your not guaranteed a fully charge electric jack apon starting ur shift. Penske Logistics is a 3rd party service. The work here is not hard general lifting, pulling and pushing.
