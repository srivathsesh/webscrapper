I have never had a major accident with Penske nor any other company I have worked for yet I have served a 4 day suspension while my operations manager conducted an investigation, and am now serving a suspension over another investigation! They score you on the number of hard breaks you have, for letting your truck idle too long, and count it against you for going .1 miles per hour over the speed limit!If one driver has an accident, everyone loses part of their safety bonus! They tell you to go through the chain of command if there is any issues, but yet you can't seem to get past the operations manager, even if your issue is with the operations manager.

1072519445,Frac Sand Driver (Former Employee) –  , TX,Odessa,2018-09-23,1,Penske Logistics doesn't belong in the oilfield!,I hauled frac sand for their Hicrush account in Midland Odessa area and the ops manager had no oilfield or truck driving experience whatsoever and did not want to learn except the hard way. The shift supervisors treated their drivers like children and didn't realize that if it weren't for their drivers THEY WOULD NOT HAVE THEIR JOB! they knew nothing about frac sand much less how to order it. If this company would just hire managers with real time oilfield driving experience they would fair alot better. The pay is not as good as they THINK it is because their competitors are offering alot better pay and incentives than these folks. I would highly suggest that you not work for them there are far better frac sand outfits to work for in West Texas.

This job would be decent if the managenment would leave you alone and let you do your job. They insisted on micro managing your every move. They never understood issues that would arise on the road. You could make a round trip in half of the time they gave you and they would still question why it took you that long. I would not advise any driver to apply at the Lithia Springs location. I did hear other drivers at the other locations talk about how much happier they were at their locations. They want you to work 50+ hours a week, but then pay you part time wages with no benefits.

So do your benefits.Low under market value pay, no real overtime to make up and cheap poorly maintained trucks. Its a fill in to a better job somewhere else though and I have just realized it after a year of service. Some contracts are better than others so pay may be higher or even lower. Mostly lower. My contract I have to use PTO to cover my 40 hours if there closed for snow days etc. I struggle to get 8 hours in a day. Its a good Job for simi retired or part time. I worry everyday my job will be cut though and I am looking for other work now. No real advancment.Penske management locally is awesome though and they make you want to do a good job.Contact management and staff are jerks who treat you like a moron. That also seems to be company wide with most contracts. Basically your a number and a seat filler.

1054659586,Driver (Current Employee) –  , IN,Fort Wayne,2016-02-06,3,Contracted to poorly managed paper supply company.,The typical work day started at 6:00 AM. Upon arrival I would inspect my truck and sign in to my electronic logs. I then helped the loaders finish loading the truck and then checked and secured my load. The length of the day varied depending on the miles driven and the type of deliveries made. I would then return to the warehouse and finalize unloading and paperwork. I was able to help my supervisor with routing which helped me keep those skills in use. The company we were contracted to work for was an interesting and sometimes frustrating experience including poor management and employees with bad attitudes as well as low safety standards. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the contracted company and not knowing when you would be finished on any given day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being outside in nice weather and interacting with the delivery customers.,New equipment,Some long days

If your one to be sold that you can own the world by all means Do Apply!   Don't get me wrong, the driver position is a steady job, you'll get ur hours, (40 hr work week) but don't expect to make it rich here (penske mgmt micromanages your work hours).  The benefits are pretty good, the healthcare is affordable if ur single.  The 4 day work week is catchy, but there's only 2 shifts (12AM-2AM & 4PM-6PM) All the equipment (electric jacks, manuel jacks, hand trucks, tractors, trailers etc..) is shared between the AM PM drivers so your not guaranteed a fully charge electric jack apon starting ur shift. Penske Logistics is a 3rd party service. The work here is not hard general lifting, pulling and pushing.  The stress-related part is when the warehouse crew fails to properly wrap pallets and all trailers are preloaded.  Since penske is only in charge of the logistics side, penske can only ask the warehouse mgmt to address the same repeated nuisance.  Basically everyone here is just a number.",Weekly pay,"Pay, mgmt"

Lack of communication and organization as well as inefficiency. I've hostled at major locations such as Gallo and Amazon and actually thrived. At this Penske account it's a joke!My suggestion would be to implement an on-board computer system for yard trucks, this way hostlers can pick and choose moves far more efficiently. I'd also like to add that the amount of hostlers at the site can easily be reduced from 8-7 to 4-5. I myself was able to handle 80-100 moves in a 10 hour shift at Gallo.
