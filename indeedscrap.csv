People that ride the clock and steal hours are not punished, but rather rewarded by getting big paychecks. I ignored all the favoritism and kept minding my own business. I was able to clear mid 60's and be home every night. That being said I worked 70 hour weeks for 2 years straight. This is important to know also....If you get hurt on the job they are self insured work comp. This is not a benefit to the injured party.The potential for this to be a great place to work is there. No seniority at my location code made tensions between drivers when it came to playing favorites for the easy jobs when they came up. Great pay and very bad benefits, United Healthcare with huge deductibles. Really good 401K 4 percent match. My location code had drivers drive and that's it, no touch freight, mostly preloaded trailers and live unloads and some drop and hooks. Electronic logs and in two direction dash cams.

1072591207,Driver (Former Employee) –  , CT,Waterbury,2018-09-26,1,"Nature of job was easy, but management is TERRIBLE","Worked as Transfer Driver out of Waterbury shop. It was easy (and low pay reflected that), but senior management gave little support to those who actually got things done. Meanwhile, they kept or promoted incompetents. Very political. One supervisor had no clue what he was doing, but then got promoted because of nepotism. Another supervisor knew his stuff, busted his butt for company, and was a talented young mechanic to boot, but the idiots in Hartford let him slip away because of their political BS. Company constantly harps, ""Zero tolerance."" But has one driver who has had incident after incident, speeding in customer's lot, accidents and didn't inform company, wastes tons of time stopping at convenience stores, etc, but management makes excuse after excuse to keep him. (And because he's supposedly on his last 'strike,' the snake tries to get his fellow co-drivers into trouble in multiple ways.) Meanwhile, if you are a good driver who does things in a safe, timely manner, but you get so much as a scratch on your arm that might need treatment, you are threatened with termination by the strong-arming regional manager. Totally backwards. Subsequently, turnover is rampant, at least in the Waterbury shop. This ends up putting much more work and strain on those still there, supervisors, techs, drivers, etc.. Over time this year, the place has become a mess.  Breakrooms and bathrooms are a disgrace because cleaning crew no longer comes. They can't even afford to pay landscapers to cut the little strip of grass in front of shop. Add it all up and it's not a good situation.",Most coworkers are good people.,"Management, especially terrible senior management in Hartford."

Nowhere on the ad did they say they pay cents per mile...you drive 1,800-2,000 miles in 4 days and put in 10-12 hour days you're suppose to have off on Wednesday but they are so short on drivers they make you come in on your days off and run a local run and they still pay you cents per mile...you have to pay for your own hotel and they reimburse in your paycheck..so for example my paycheck every week is $1,075 and that's with them reimbursing me the $200-$300 I'm putting out every week for hotels..so if you take away the $200-$300 they reimburse you after all the work you put in your check is really anywhere from $700-$875 a week after all the hours and miles you do it isnt worth it..dont work here also they put cameras in the trucks to watch you",Benefits,"Too many miles, too many hours, cameras in trucks, not enough money!"

However, I dont know where these people claiming Ryder has great benefits are getting their insurance from.  Ryder insurance is TERRIBLE.

1069443336,AZ Driver (Current Employee) –  ,NA,Toyota Canada Accounts,2018-04-22,5,Steamlined operations,"If you are a newbie trucker, probably not the place for you as they expect you to be a professional who knows their stuff coming in. I see a lot of complaints on here that are obviously from newbie drivers who are not really familiar with the industry yet. But if it's not your first rodeo, Ryder is a great company to work for in my experience because for the most part, you get the same truck everyday, you pretty much know what your hours are going to be each week, management completely leaves you alone if you are doing your job correctly and on the TMMC accounts at least, the work is extremely easy work. No touch, big customer yards, fairly relaxed pickup/delivery schedule and the equipment, though not great, is not too bad. I think the oldest trucks we have on our account are 2013's. If I do have one complaint, it is the lack of social and driver appreciation programs. For a company as big as Ryder, they can do better than a $25 gift card from Walmart as a Christmas bonus. Quarterly safety meeting, though paid, are pretty useless as far as teaching an experienced driver anything new and burn 4 or 5 of your Saturdays per year. Dealing with Ryder's repair shops as a Ryder Integrated Logistics driver can be frustrating as they tend to prioritize rental customers rather than their own employees.","Easy work, industry average pay, steady regular hours",A little aloof regarding driver appreciation/recognition

There is small talk about the proposed moves of rental vehicles and I settle in and wait and listen for the instructions.I have learned patience and relaxation from this position as in most scenarios there is little to no rushing to meet a deadline.Management has been just as professional and polite with the drivers as with the customers who are drivers too.Co-workers can be unpredictable and the format is to have two ride together most of the time. It might help if both were interviewed together for compatibility purposes.The most difficult of duties in the job as I have experienced it has been in dealing with driver partners with extreme behavioral differences from myself. On the other hand, when a pairing is compatible the experience is pleasant and productive.",Uniformity across the organization.,Unpredictability of the driving experience. It can be very challenging.

I learned that no matter how you try in todays and their work enviroment you just a number and easily replaceable . High turnover.

My check changes every week.. they change the way they pay you every week and you cant take vacation when you have earned it ! When you call HR to complain you are told to contact your manager. When you contact your manager they tell you to go back to HR !! You cant access the employee manuel because it is constantly being revised.. so they can change the rules in midstream and not pay the drivers the time that they are owed. They are being sued currently for this very thing and have been sued in the past by drivers and lost in court.. at least the judges in these cases could see how corrupt Ryder is ! They dont care if you have been here 10 years .. 20 years.. no loyalty at all.. they will keep your vacation payr and not feel bad about it. The money that they dont pay you for your vacation goes into the managers pocket as a bonus.. be warned.. check this information out regarding the vacation pay for Ryder,, they also are putting cameras in our trucks in the next couple of weeks so they can watch the drivers constantly.. that way they wont have to pay safety bonuses out either.. more money in the managers pocket. I am writing this in hopes that another driver wont make this same mistake that I did. I have been here to long to get out.. but you can stop yourself from being put in the same position.. run away from this company and spread the word to  more... other drivers that you know so that wont apply here either.
